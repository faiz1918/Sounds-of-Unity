# Description
Sounds Of Unity is an interactive project that can be accessed via the web, which helps users explore remote parts of the community using audio, photographs, and CSS animations. I aimed to design the culture of unity through stories and common narratives shared by members of one community. The visuals with respect to the community were very perceptively pleasing, and smooth CSS animations played a major role, along with responsive audio playback. The website is split into individual sections such as the homepage, which serves as an index for the entire site, a stories page which houses the audio narrations for the stories, an image gallery, an about page, and finally a contact us form. Everything on the website stands out with regards to the cordiality and exuberance of the community.
I developed the website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and very little JavaScript for the responsive components like the audio controller, console and form validation classes. Capturing and editing sounds with respect to the theme and keeping them clear and interesting was done using Audacity. The CSS was crafted very carefully, paying a lot of attention it to be orderly and make the layout responsive. transitions and hover effects were achieved with use of CSS animations. The images selected to be used for this project portray the startling difference and intensity contained in the community. This project was published using GitHub Pages because it's free to use and easily available on the internet.
